## I Didn't Want to Write You A Love Poem

I didn't want to write you a love poem,  
Blunder my way through every cliche,  
Tell you that you make my heart flutter, skip a beat,  
That you somehow made me stumble head over feet.  

Didn't want to write that just thinking of you makes me smile,  
Or I don't know, you have really nice eyes,  
That your just being out there, happy, is enough for me,  
That you've taught me the kind of person I so want to be.  

Want to write that I think you're pretty, cool,  
I mean I genuinely enjoy spending time with you,   
That it feels like I can tell you anything, and you listen to my every word,   
That I'm not just some dude, but a man with emotions that deserve to be heard.   

To write that I feel this way, I'm hopelessly gone,   
Think I'm stuck with these feelings for good.  
All I can do is try and show it some way,  
and hope that it's understood.  

I didn't want to write you a love poem,  
Cheapen feelings, like open eyes a kiss.   
So I wrote you this.
