## I Have No Regrets (I can't sleep)

I have no regrets,  
Except for that one time, when it didn't..  
But I could have.. 

I have no regrets,  
Except for that one time, where I didn't...  
But I should have...

OK, some regrets,  
But only a few that keep me up at night.

Maybe, not so few regrets,  
I stare at the ceiling till morning light.

I have, regrets,  
But I won't let them ruin, this day new.

I have, regrets,  
Will try not to regret, this today too.
